# lfm Documentation


lfm, short for "last.fm", consists of a set of tools, written in [Go](https://golang.org/), to interact unofficially with the [Last.fm API](https://www.last.fm/api) and [Discord Rich Presence](https://discord.com/rich-presence).

## [`lfm-api`](./lfm-api)

Read the [API documentation](./lfm-api) for more information on how to use `lfm-api`.

## [`lfm-cli`](./lfm-cli)

Read the [CLI documentation](./lfm-cli) for more information on how to use `lfm-cli`.

## [`lfm-gui`](https://github.com/twangodev/lfm-gui)

Currently, work is being done on the GUI version of lfm-cli. Stay tuned for more information.
